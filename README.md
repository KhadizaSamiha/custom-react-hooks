# ðŸ§© Custom React Hooks

A simple and interactive collection of custom React hooks with live demos. These reusable hooks help simplify common logic like localStorage persistence, debouncing input, detecting outside clicks, and tracking window size â€” all wrapped in a clean, minimal UI built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… `useLocalStorage` â€“ Sync state with `localStorage`
- âœ… `useDebounce` â€“ Debounce a fast-changing value (like input)
- âœ… `useClickOutside` â€“ Detect clicks outside a target element
- âœ… `useWindowSize` â€“ Track window width and height

Each hook includes a demo component showcasing how to use it effectively in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ§© Custom Hooks Overview

This project includes several reusable custom React hooks to enhance UI interactivity and state handling.

### ðŸ”¸ `useLocalStorage<T>(key, initialValue)`
Persists a state value in `localStorage` so it remains available even after the page is reloaded.

### ðŸ”¸ `useDebounce<T>(value, delay)`
Delays updates to a value until after a specified wait time. Great for reducing unnecessary API calls on every keystroke.

### ðŸ”¸ `useClickOutside<T>(handler)`
Triggers a callback when the user clicks or touches outside the referenced element. Commonly used to close modals, tooltips, or dropdowns.

### ðŸ”¸ `useWindowSize()`
Tracks and returns the current window dimensions (`width` and `height`), updating in real-time on window resize.
